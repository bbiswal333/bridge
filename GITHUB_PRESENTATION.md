"Github Presentation

Hi, this is Thomas, I am developer and product owner in the tools team here in Walldorf and with me is Lydia who is a designer in our team. Today we would like to show you how to leverage the power of GitHub as a strong foundation for SAP product teams. Using GitHub we can bring a whole new meaning of collaboration inside and accross development teams at SAP and build amazing tools around that.

Actually, Lydia is just back from her vacation and would like to see what is going on in the bridge project, a new dashboard for developers. Therefore she can look at our project page on github, check the progress and even contribute via ozarcs, a new collaboration tool. And now, we would like to show you how that works.

- show PSCHub 
- select an existing plan
- select 'will comply' for ACC-231 (contrast in pictures - to trigger design work)
- submit to GitHub
- Assign the newly created issue to Designer (Lydia) 
- Designer: see that there is a design issue/ psc compliance issue / email notification??
- start ozarcs and launch bridge application
- make change via fileshare
- commit change and resolve issue via "solves #issue" (#thisIsAwesome - Ben)
- mention that the PSC will show the transparency based on the issue status (current Dev status is not ready to show this step - David broke it recently)

As you can see by utilizing GitHub and our connected tools we can reduce the distance to code, embrance the industry standard for develpers and focus on building great products.
