Please let us know what can be improved and what you like about Bridge. Therefore, please provide us detailed information, e.g. include screenshots whenever possible.<br><br>

In case you want to <b>report a bug</b> we'd ask you to refresh your browser first (Win: F5, Mac: CMD + R) and try to reproduce it. We are shipping new versions of Bridge frequently and have experienced browser-caching issues especially with IE and Firefox. <br><br>

We have 2 feedback channels:<br><br>
1) If you are already familiar with GitHub, please do not hesitate to <a href="https://github.wdf.sap.corp/bridge/bridge/issues/new" target="_blank">create an issue in our GitHub Project</a>. We also look forward to any pull request from you in order to extend & enhance this application.<br><br>
2) Alternatively, you can <a href="mailto:DL_53304587DF15DB5AAC000CD9@exchange.sap.corp">mail us</a> ;-).
