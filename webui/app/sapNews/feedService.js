Nevertheless, working with this customer is no walk in the park for Global Managing Partner Bruno Micaud. Until recently, SAP’s account access was mainly l]]><![CDATA[imited to the IT division. In fact, the lack of harmonization between the company’s three major divisions and its reluctance to adopt new IT concepts had led to a relationship whereby SAP was a mere IT supplier, rather than an equal business partner.</p> <p>Thanks to an initiative started about a year ago by the SAP account team, the customer now sees SAP as a visionary innovator for the oil &amp; gas industry.</p> <p>It all began when SAP participated for the first time in the Total group-internal UNISUP SALSA Conference (USC) in Barcelona in 2013. UNISUP (Unified Information System for Upstream) and SALSA (Simplified Accounting and Logistic System for Small Affiliates) are the two ERP systems used by Total for its Exploration and Production (EP) division. These systems are based on SAP templates and cover business processes for maintenance, purchasing, logistics and financial accounting.  Total&#8217;s employees discovered a new side of SAP via Mobility and Design Thinking sessions. In early 2014, the SAP account team convinced the customer to capitalize and expand on this experience by holding a large-scale Design Thinking session at this year&#8217;s USC event in Cannes. In this half-day activity, SAP employees would help 150 participants from around the world identify business needs and generate innovative ideas.</p> <p><b>SAP seizes the opportunity                                                         </b></p> <div id="attachment_50440" class="wp-caption articleimage alignright" style="width: 300px; margin-left:10px"><a href="https://blogs.wdf.sap.corp/sapnews_en/?attachment_id=50440"><a href="https://blogs.wdf.sap.corp/sapnews_en/files/2014/07/Total2.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-50440" alt="Total2" src="https://blogs.wdf.sap.corp/sapnews_en/files/2014/07/Total2-248x185.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a></a><div class="image_label"> <div class="image_label_button" style="margin-right:2px"><a href="https://blogs.wdf.sap.corp/sapnews_en/?attachment_id=50440"><img width="15" height="15" src="https://blogs.wdf.sap.corp/sapnews_en/wp-content/themes/sapnews_v3/images/resize.gif" /></a></div> Divided into groups, participants worked through topics relevant to their areas of expertise.</div></div> <p>SAP jumped at this great opportunity. Eighteen SAP colleagues from various divisions (labs, consulting, industry value engineering, presales, and sales) participated in training over the course of seven half-days to conduct the Design Thinking event. Beyond an introduction to Total and the oil &amp; gas industry, the course included material on Design Thinking and group facilitation techniques. SAP wanted to seize this opportunity to improve its business relationship with Total for the long term. The objective was never to make a quick buck, but rather to polish SAP&#8217;s image and lay the groundwork for new SAP solutions.</p> <p>The actual event was held at the Hotel Majestic in Cannes. Divided into groups for financial accounting, purchasing, maintenance, logistics and IT, participants worked through topics relevant to their areas of expertise. This included challenges such as: &#8220;How does the financial controller maximize the return on production from wellhead to gas pump?&#8221; or &#8220;How do we improve business insights for decision makers from existing data?”</p> <p>Activities that cause experts to step out of their comfort zones and deal with the broader issues facing humanity can help unleash creativity. This session proved to be no exception. And, in the true spirit of the Cannes Film festival, there was an award’s ceremony at the end to recognize the best teams and most innovative ideas.</p> <p>But what, in the end, did the event achieve?</p> <p>For a start, SAP earned a lot of praise from the customer. In an e-mail to SAP, Robin van der Sande, business information systems coordinator at Total EP, described how the event opened their eyes to completely new ways of approaching complex subjects. He went on to explain how it greatly improved SAP’s image at Total.</p> <p>According to Claire Lauper, EMEA program manager for Design Thinking with SAP, Total EP now perceives SAP to be: &#8220;An innovative company and a real partner whose competencies extend beyond ERP.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Not only have we significantly improved SAP’s reputation, but we have also identified a whole range of new business requirements that may open up new opportunities for us,&#8221; says Bruno, adding that this could also be carried over to other Total divisions. He goes on to explain that SAP had never before worked so closely with the various lines of business at Total.</p> <p>In closing, Bruno says that SAP substantially improved the user experience by positioning Fiori technology. What’s more, Total and SAP are currently discussing how to build on the outcomes and insights of the largest Design Thinking workshop SAP has ever held.</p> <table class="blue_box_alone" border="0" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="3"> <tbody> <tr> <td><strong>Useful links</strong></p> <ul> <li style="text-align: left"><a href="http://www.total.com/en/" target="_blank">Total Homepage</a></li> </ul> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded><wfw:commentRss>https://blogs.wdf.sap.corp/sapnews_en/2014/08/design-thinking-goes-xxl/feed/</wfw:commentRss><slash:comments>1</slash:comments></item><item><title>Mark Gibbs: China Will be Our Second Home</title><link>https://blogs.wdf.sap.corp/sapnews_en/2014/08/mark-gibbs-china-will-be-our-second-home/</link><comments>https://blogs.wdf.sap.corp/sapnews_en/2014/08/mark-gibbs-china-will-be-our-second-home/#comments</comments><pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2014 10:04:49 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[ Monika Michel ]]></dc:creator><category><![CDATA[ Business&Innovation ]]></category><category><![CDATA[ SAP on TV ]]></category><category><![CDATA[ SAP-on-TV ]]></category><guid isPermaLink="false">https://blogs.wdf.sap.corp/sapnews_en/?p=50651</guid><description><![CDATA[In an interview on CNBC\'s Squawk Box, Mark Gibbs, President SAP Greater China, said that SAP is taking the approach of making China a second home and being complementary to China\'s IT market.

The new SAP Portfolio team will support the company to reduce complexity.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During the last All Hands meeting, SAP’s CEO Bill McDermott reaffirmed SAP’s strategy to become THE cloud company powered by SAP HANA. “To execute on our strategy we must simplify our portfolio end to end”, says Sandra Stegmann, EVP and new head of SAP Portfolio. “Our goal is to transl]]><![CDATA[ate SAP’s strategy into sound investment decisions and offerings that drive innovation and value for our customers”, says Sandra.</p> <p>Effective June 1, the Board agreed on setting up a new unit called SAP Portfolio with a clear mission: Simplify SAP’s portfolio end-to-end.  To deliver on this mission, the SAP Portfolio team has five key objectives (see box), which provide SAP’s customers with simple solution offerings, and govern portfolio investment decisions end-to-end, from product development to sales, service, cloud operations and support, involving partners and M&amp;A. In summary, SAP Portfolio supports both growth and simplification.</p> <p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://video.wdf.sap.corp:1080/f/tv/?/portal/140718_Stegmann" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-50593" alt="SandraVideo" src="https://blogs.wdf.sap.corp/sapnews_en/files/2014/08/SandraVideo.jpg" width="500" height="282" /></a></p> <p>One key growth area is to become THE cloud company reaching €3 to €3.5 billion cloud subscription revenue until 2017. To deliver on this target, SAP needs to continuously shift investments into the cloud. “Cloud is not just a deployment option, but a completely new provisioning and consumption paradigm for our customers,” adds Sandra. Customers express the need of a new end-to-end-consumption experience of SAP’s cloud solutions, including discovery, trial, implementation, go-live, and operation. Customer onboarding and consumption have become as vital as the product itself.</p> <p>Another future key growth driver is the Internet of Things, which will fundamentally reshape business models of leading companies globally.  Worldwide expenditures of Internet of Things investments reached €45 billion with annual growth of 25%. By targeting Internet of Things as part of SAP’s portfolio and capturing this market, SAP will be able to build the next generation of enterprise applications while at the same time drive SAP HANA adoption.</p> <p>In parallel, the new team aims to simplify SAP’s portfolio. Today, more than 50% of SAP products in the sales bags generate less than 1% of revenue. To change this, the current portfolio needs to be simplified, involving SAP’s customers, ecosystem, custom development as well as new routes to market in the portfolio process.  This will allow SAP to re-focus efforts and invest better into new growth opportunities.</p> <table class="green_box_alone" border="0" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="3"> <tbody> <tr> <td><strong>5 Key Objectives of SAP Portfolio:</strong></p> <ol> <li>Provide our customers with simple solution offerings and roadmaps to drive innovation and value for end-users</li> <li>Support the Board on portfolio investment decisions to execute SAP’s strategy<b> </b>linked in the financial plan 2015/17.</li> <li>Manage product portfolio and resource allocation across all market categories, industries, LOBs and regions<b> </b>to accelerate growth as well as drive sunset of products<b> </b>with low adoption.</li> <li>Drive simplification and agility<b> </b>of portfolio processes and tools and increase transparency<b> </b>for sound decisions – both for continuous innovations and breakthrough innovation.</li> <li>Manage the portfolio across make-buy-partners<b> </b>decision and involve customers and partners<b> </b>across all channels<b>.</b></li> </ol> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>To support the success of portfolio management, the team developed a new governance model from strategy to execution across all portfolio areas. A key element of the new portfolio governance is a quarterly portfolio steering meeting with Board sponsors and key stakeholders, as well as collaboration with the accountable leaders from development and go-to-market (“two-in-the-box model”) for the respective areas, e.g. Industry Cloud, LOBs, Business Network. Additionally, “customer and user feedback as well as usage data are essential to drive rapid innovation” says Sandra.</p> <p>For more information please go to the new SAP Portfolio JAM Group.</p> <table class="blue_box_alone" border="0" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="3"> <tbody> <tr> <td><strong>Useful Links</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href="https://jam4.sapjam.com/groups/about_page/oDBXisN93oD6q9a1g608HH" target="_blank">SAP Portfolio JAM Group</a></li> </ul> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded><wfw:commentRss>https://blogs.wdf.sap.corp/sapnews_en/2014/08/simplifying-saps-portfolio/feed/</wfw:commentRss><slash:comments>13</slash:comments></item><item><title>Blog: A Mammoth on Your Wrist</title><link>https://blogs.wdf.sap.corp/sapnews_en/2014/08/blog-a-mammoth-on-your-wrist/</link><comments>https://blogs.wdf.sap.corp/sapnews_en/2014/08/blog-a-mammoth-on-your-wrist/#comments</comments><pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2014 10:52:03 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[ Ingo Woesner ]]></dc:creator><category><![CDATA[ People&Culture ]]></category><category><![CDATA[ SAP News ]]></category><category><![CDATA[ culture ]]></category><category><![CDATA[ feature ]]></category><category><![CDATA[ Ingo Woesner ]]></category><category><![CDATA[ watch-strap buckles ]]></category><category><![CDATA[ Work-Life Balance ]]></category><guid isPermaLink="false">https://blogs.wdf.sap.corp/sapnews_en/?p=50556</guid><description><![CDATA[SAP employee Ingo Woesner fashions unusual materials into unique watch-strap buckles to create time pieces with a difference.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<table style="width: 57%" border="0" align="right"> <tbody> <tr> <td> <table border="0" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="3" align="right"> <tbody> <tr> <td> <blockquote><p><b><i>Story Highlights </i></b></p> <p><em>SAP employee Ingo Woesner creates unique watch-strap buckles.<b></b></em></p> <p><em>They]]><![CDATA[are hand-made from specialist woods.<b></b></em></p> <p><em>His hobby gives him new energy and strength.<b></b></em></p> <p><em>Ingo spends about eight hours on his hobby every</em><br /> <em>week.</em></p></blockquote> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>In today&#8217;s]]><![CDATA[working world, we&#8217;re all striving to maximize efficiency, to streamline, and to optimize processes.

They’re art. Unshackled by the necessity of purpose and &#8220;optimized&#8221; for beauty; they’re something that no one actually needs, but that fires passion and excitement among enthusiasts.</p> <p>When I&#8217;m in my workshop, I use my hands rather than my head. The work is arduous, dirty, and sometimes loud. I sit on my own in a tiny space, listening to great music, reflecting, experimenting, changing things around, and trying again and again until I see the light at the end of the tunnel and I can hold the fruit of my labor in my hands.</p> <table class="green_box_alone" border="0" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="3"> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p style="text-align: left"><b>Four square meters is enough</b></p> <p><b></b>Ingo&#8217;s workshop is an old fitted kitchen in the basement of his home.

I&#8217;m holding a piece of art that I&#8217;ve created with my own hands. I then peruse my collection of watch straps to find a good match and add the watch case itself to create an ornate symbiosis of shape, color, and function. Then I think about how to photograph the finished article to make it look stunning. Once I&#8217;ve edited my photos, I place them on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Finewatchbuckles" target="_blank">my Facebook artist page</a>, on <a href="http://www.finewatchbuckles.com/Welcome.html" target="_blank">my website</a>, and on international watch forums.</p> <p>Those are the places where I express my enthusiasm and receive messages of recognition and appreciation for a product that I have created and &#8220;composed&#8221; all by myself.</p> <p>That probably makes me sound introverted and lonely: on the contrary.</p> <p>When I showcased my first watch-strap buckle made from fossilized mammoth ivory on a Web forum, the creative community latched on to me very quickly. Well-known wrist-band artists and niche watchmakers whom I&#8217;d hardly had a chance to place an order with in the past, were fascinated and suddenly wanted to work with me.</p> <p>I encountered lots of like-minded watch artists with whom I now co-develop; I set up joint ventures, support pilot projects, and receive inquiries from all over the world every week – for a pretty much &#8220;purposeless&#8221; product that does no more than bring joy and radiate beauty.</p> <p>But that gives me new energy and strength. And I need that every day in my job as an outbound product manager in the dynamic environment of hybris/SAP Suite integration and our omni-channel strategy – a role that suits me but which requires a great deal of creativity.</p> <p>My aesthetic hobby helps me find a balance so that I can give my best in my job, both now and in the future. That&#8217;s my recipe for well-being.

In this case, it was a second-hand <i>Officine Panerai</i> designer watch that I&#8217;d treated myself to from a bonus payment.</p> <p>The saying goes that a Panerai watch is like a child: You don&#8217;t understand its magic until you have one.  Even if the comparison is far from accurate, a Panerai, with its elegant Italian design and ingenious mechanism, holds a fascination that seduces its owner into wanting to wear it on all kinds of different straps. Changing the strap takes two minutes.</p> <p>Consequently, a vibrant community of accessory artists has sprung up around the Panerai brand in recent years. They supply the &#8220;Paneristi&#8221;, as the lovers of the Panerai brand are known, with hand-made and often personalized watch straps and buckles created from a vast range of specialist and rare materials. This cult has quickly spread to other brands, triggering a trend toward personalization.</p> <p>You start off by developing and nurturing your own particular taste. Then you buy new straps and buckles and sell the more conservative ones that no longer fit your taste to other enthusiasts.  You may also drift <i>off-piste</i> –  as I did  – to specialized and unusual materials like straps made of old baseball gloves and footballs, antique military bags, ripped jeans, and fur, and hand-made buckles fashioned from Damast steel, naval bronze, mokume gane, a high-voltage copper fuse element from an old hospital, or antique coins.</p> <p>Sounds crazy, doesn&#8217;t it? After all, why would anyone wrap such exotic items around their wrist?</p> <p><b>Magical blasts from the past                                                                                       </b></p> <p>Most prestigious watches, which are designed to be an expression of the wearer&#8217;s individuality, ironically often come fitted with a metal buckle that is worth 10 euros and a run-of-the-mill strap made from farmed crocodile or alligator leather – without emotion, without history, and just plain cruel.</p> <p>That&#8217;s why I don&#8217;t wear straps made from manufactured exotic leather on principle.  But I do own some stunning straps made from newt, snake, hornback crocodile skin and even from fur – all sourced from old bags, coats, and hats bought at flea markets – that were crafted individually and by hand.</p> <p>Like the 50-year-old baseball glove, the 60s medicine ball from the former German Democratic Republic, the World War II flight jacket with its patinaed horse leather, and the piece of Swiss military leather from the 40s – complete with the original saddler&#8217;s stamp.

When woolly mammoths grazed the Russian steppe, homo sapiens were still battling for survival with the Neanderthals. Africa was innovation leader at this ancient time. 35.000 years ago the greatest innovation was the sewing needle, which radically changed human life by allowing to make clothes in order to hunt longer without cooling down. Just 13.000 years ago, the next, even bigger innovation, the invention of agriculture, allowed humans to ensure survival while growing in numbers.</p> <p>Today, SAP is the world leader in enterprise software, and, more importantly, an innovation leader. We are driving innovation from the front every day. With our enterprise solutions, we have a significant influence on the fate of the global economy.</p> <p>These are the contrasting sensations that I feel when I wear my little works of art on my wrist in the office. They keep my feet on the ground, because they create a counterbalance to the modern world. A world which we at SAP have the power to actively shape in a way that is virtually unthinkable anywhere else.</p> <table class="blue_box_alone" border="0" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="3"> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p style="text-align: left"><b>Useful links</b><b></b></p> <ul> <li style="text-align: left"><a href="https://portal.wdf.sap.corp/irj/portal?NavigationTarget=navurl://2ee46a8baba36258f7953d8fbd793b62&amp;url=/Infocenters/Human%20Resources%20for%20SAP/Employee%20Services/Health/Global/Work-Life-Balance/index.html" target="_blank">Work-Life Management at SAP</a></li> </ul> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded><wfw:commentRss>https://blogs.wdf.sap.corp/sapnews_en/2014/08/blog-a-mammoth-on-your-wrist/feed/</wfw:commentRss><slash:comments>5</slash:comments></item><item><title>SAPedia – a Crowd-Sourced Encyclopedia</title><link>https://blogs.wdf.sap.corp/sapnews_en/2014/07/sapedia-a-crowd-sourced-encyclopedia/</link><comments>https://blogs.wdf.sap.corp/sapnews_en/2014/07/sapedia-a-crowd-sourced-encyclopedia/#comments</comments><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jul 2014 10:14:03 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[ Christoph Haffner ]]></dc:creator><category><![CDATA[ SAP News ]]></category><category><![CDATA[ Workplace ]]></category><category><![CDATA[ feature ]]></category><category><![CDATA[ SAPedia ]]></category><guid isPermaLink="false">https://blogs.wdf.sap.corp/sapnews_en/?p=50418</guid><description><![CDATA[SAPedia offers plain explanations instead of marketing talk and encourages employees to participate and edit.]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you just been in a meeting where you heard another three-letter-acronym that you don’t know the meaning of?

SAP and the event organizer collaborated on several co-innovation projects, developing apps and analysis tools based on SAP HANA to make the event an even richer experience for spectators. All CHIO visitors were given the opportunity to try out this new technology first-hand at the SAP booth.</p> <p>The CHIO app proved extremely popular. It not only allowed fans to access schedule and location information, it also gave them a chance to test and show off their knowledge of both the event and equestrian sports in general.</p> <p>Packed with more than 600 questions, the CHIO Aachen Quiz had fans compete for the title of &#8220;CHIO Champion&#8221; across a variety of levels.</p> <p>The real fan favorite, however, was the Audience Judge function. This app allowed spectators to judge riders and horses during the dressage and vaulting competitions at the same time as the official judges. The resulting audience-generated ranking list was even displayed on the official stadium scoreboards.</p> <p><b>Analysis for eventing riders</b></p> <p>Another app premiere came in form of the SAP Equestrian Analytics prototype. It was developed especially for competitors in horseback riding&#8217;s most prestigious discipline, known as eventing. Here, riders and horses compete in a mixed event that combines dressage, show jumping, and cross-country competition. Using the app, riders can analyze their cross-country rides in great detail and work on improving their performance more effectively than ever before. SAP Equestrian Analytics processes data collected during rides through special sensors that were developed specifically for equestrian sports. It later uses this data to create dazzling visualizations. &#8220;The software has provided me with completely new ways to analyze my rides,&#8221; says Ingrid Klimke, an internationally renowned trainer and two-time Olympic gold medalist. She acts as a consultant for the development of SAP&#8217;s equestrian sports solutions. &#8220;Not only can I review how I approached the obstacles, I can also get information on my speed and heart rate,&#8221; she explains.</p> <iframe width="480" height="271" src="http://www.sap-tv.com/clip/32595/embed/?width=480&amp;height=271&amp;autoStart=false&amp;stageVideo=true&amp;vidres=360p&amp;myServer=%2Fclip%2F&amp;showTitle=true&amp;showRelated=true&amp;showSharing=true&amp;colors=sap&amp;lang=en" frameborder="0"></iframe> <p>These features also make the app attractive to fans, since it allows them to track riders throughout the entire course. Usually it is difficult to see everything, and therefore to compare performances.</p> <p>Digital rider data was also combined with live video streams from cameras on riders’ helmets to give spectators an impression of what it&#8217;s like to be racing along the course. Riders and fans alike loved this virtual rider&#8217;s perspective of the event.</p> <table class="green_box_alone" border="0" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="3"> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p style="text-align: left"><b>CHIO Aachen</b></p> <p style="text-align: left">The CHIO World Equestrian Festival in Aachen is the official Nations Cup of the Federal Republic of Germany. With more than 350 competitors from 30 countries and over 550 horses competing in front of more than 350,000 visitors, it is the biggest sports event in Germany and the biggest equestrian sports event in the world. Over ten days, the world&#8217;s most elite riders compete in five disciplines across individual and team events. SAP is the official technology sponsor of the event for the third consecutive time in 2014.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>Our colleagues whose apps were presented in Aachen must have felt like real winners. But they were not the only ones: Sixteen SAP employees each won a pair of day-tickets to enjoy the event&#8217;s unique atmosphere against the beautiful backdrop of Aachen’s Soers district. Four of them were also treated to a bonus meet and greet with Ingrid, who welcomed the horse enthusiasts and their companions onto the cross-country course before explaining the intricacies of the five-kilometer circuit.</p> <p>At one point, Ingrid even climbed into one of the shallow jump pools to demonstrate the ideal route of her ride. &#8220;I found it absolutely amazing how much time Ingrid Klimke took to give us a real sense of the course and her fascinating sport. I&#8217;m sure all of us will take away very fond memories of this day,&#8221; said Holger Maaßen, one of the lucky ticket winners.</p> <table class="blue_box_alone" border="0" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="3"> <tbody> <tr> <td> <h6>Useful Links:</h6> <ul> <li><a href="http://www.chioaachen.de/" target="_blank">CHIO Homepage</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.sap-tv.com/video/32111" target="_blank">CHIO Aachen: Transforming Equestrian Sports</a> (Video)</li> <li><a href="http://www.sap-tv.com/video/32103" target="_blank">How to Become a &#8220;CHIO Champion&#8221;</a> (Video)</li> <li><a href="http://www.sap-tv.com/video/#/32109" target="_blank">Ingrid Klimke and Sandra Auffarth on SAP Equestrian Analytics</a> (Video)<b></b></li> </ul> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded><wfw:commentRss>https://blogs.wdf.sap.corp/sapnews_en/2014/07/high-tech-for-fans-in-the-stands/feed/</wfw:commentRss><slash:comments>1</slash:comments></item><item><title>Don’t Wait for a Miracle to Charm Your Life</title><link>https://blogs.wdf.sap.corp/sapnews_en/2014/07/dont-wait-for-a-miracle-to-charm-your-life/</link><comments>https://blogs.wdf.sap.corp/sapnews_en/2014/07/dont-wait-for-a-miracle-to-charm-your-life/#comments</comments><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jul 2014 09:45:14 +0000</pubDate><dc:creator><![CDATA[ Andrea Diederichs ]]></dc:creator><category><![CDATA[ People&Culture ]]></category><category><![CDATA[ SAP News ]]></category><category><![CDATA[ culture ]]></category><category><![CDATA[ diversity ]]></category><category><![CDATA[ feature ]]></category><category><![CDATA[ mature talents ]]></category><guid isPermaLink="false">https://blogs.wdf.sap.corp/sapnews_en/?p=50272</guid><description><![CDATA[Heinrich Wegener wants to tweak the world, at work and at home.

I&#8217;ve experienced so many different situations in my life – both good and bad – that nothing can really surprise me anymore. That&#8217;s really reassuring. I&#8217;ve also realized that time is finite. So I&#8217;m careful not to be so frivolous with it. That&#8217;s the reason why I want to do things that will really make an impact. And I want to do things that will benefit others if I possibly can.</p> <blockquote><p><strong>SAP News: Can you give us an example?</strong></p></blockquote> <p><b>Heinrich: </b>The &#8220;Support Malawi&#8221; organization. I came up with the idea for it after traveling to Malawi to visit a friend who works there. I wanted to do something to promote education in this southeast African nation.</p> <blockquote><p><strong>SAP News: What exactly does the organization do?</strong></p></blockquote> <p><b>Heinrich: </b>Our projects to date have included establishing a kindergarten and extending a school. TSG Hoffenheim (a German Bundesliga soccer club) donated 400 soccer balls to the organization, which I sent to Malawi and distributed in cooperation with the Malawian Minister of Youth, Sports, and Culture and a youth sports development center. We&#8217;re currently working on a new sports-based project to promote soccer in Malawi by provide training for coaches and referees. I fly out once or twice a year to see how our projects are progressing.<br /> [[Show as slideshow]]</p> <blockquote><p><strong>SAP News: So you&#8217;re using the experience and expertise you&#8217;ve learned at SAP to make a difference elsewhere?</strong></p></blockquote> <p><b>Heinrich: </b>Absolutely. That&#8217;s how I&#8217;ve always looked at it. I can use the experience and knowledge that I&#8217;ve gathered here over the years to great effect in projects like the ones I&#8217;ve mentioned. One thing that you learn when you&#8217;ve worked at SAP for a while is how to speak with all kinds of different people. It&#8217;s the same in Malawi. It makes no difference whether you&#8217;re talking to a minister, a bishop, or a taxi driver.</p> <blockquote><p><strong>SAP News: So you work a 40-hour week and run Support Malawi in your spare time?</strong></p></blockquote> <p><b>Heinrich: </b>Yes, but that&#8217;s all part of planning my &#8220;life after SAP&#8221;. For me, retiring from SAP is rather like a project in itself. You need to start planning well in advance and thinking about what you&#8217;ll do when you no longer have a regular job. As a project manager, I guess I&#8217;m just used to having a preparation phase before the actual date for go-live&#8230;</p> <blockquote><p><strong>SAP News: When did you start thinking about your life after SAP?</strong></p></blockquote> <div id="attachment_50380" class="wp-caption articleimage alignright" style="width: 185px; margin-left:10px"><a href="https://blogs.wdf.sap.corp/sapnews_en/2014/07/dont-wait-for-a-miracle-to-charm-your-life/attachment/31/"><a href="https://blogs.wdf.sap.corp/sapnews_en/files/2014/07/31.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-50380" alt="3(1)" src="https://blogs.wdf.sap.corp/sapnews_en/files/2014/07/31.jpg" width="185" height="275" /></a></a><div class="image_label"> <div class="image_label_button" style="margin-right:2px"><a href="https://blogs.wdf.sap.corp/sapnews_en/2014/07/dont-wait-for-a-miracle-to-charm-your-life/attachment/31/"><img width="15" height="15" src="https://blogs.wdf.sap.corp/sapnews_en/wp-content/themes/sapnews_v3/images/resize.gif" /></a></div> Talent base at SAP</div></div> <p><b>Heinrich: </b>When I was in my late 40s. I just started wondering about how I would use my time. I&#8217;ve often heard of people who&#8217;ve left SAP full of excitement about finally being able to clear out their garage or go traveling. But, six months down the line, they&#8217;re gradually starting to run out of ideas.  There&#8217;s no pressure coming at you from external sources, so you have to motivate yourself. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s important to begin thinking early about how to spend your time – and with whom. You may have built up lots of contacts at SAP, but they soon start to dwindle when you leave.  You have to be active. In a nutshell, don’t wait for a miracle to charm your life.</p> <blockquote><p><strong>SAP News: From your perspective as one of SAP&#8217;s more experienced employees, what opportunities would you like to see offered at the company?</strong></p></blockquote> <p><b>Heinrich: </b>It would be great if you could switch to another department or work in a different country for six months. It seems to me that older employees often think they&#8217;re unsuitable for that kind of assignment. Which is a real shame. There are probably lots of colleagues of my age who would like that to change and who would jump at the chance to have an impact and experience something new. If there were more encouragement for older employees to switch to different departments for a while, everyone would benefit and their experience could be shared. But you do of course need to have a certain passion for adventure.</p> <blockquote><p><strong>SAP News: What do think about the term &#8220;mature talents&#8221;?</strong></p></blockquote> <p><b>Heinrich: </b>It&#8217;s much, much better than &#8220;older employees&#8221;. The word &#8220;mature&#8221; implies a very different impetus. Ask yourself what it is that makes older, or mature, employees unique? And which of these characteristics do we value in our company? The obvious answers are: experience, wide-ranging knowledge, and the breadth of different situations that more mature employees have dealt with in their lifetimes. Experienced employees are much calmer and more composed when it comes to weighing up new situations. That should be seen as a highly positive trait, and that&#8217;s something that the word &#8220;mature&#8221; aptly expresses.</p> <table class="gold_box_alone" border="0" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="3"> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p style="text-align: left"><strong>Malawi</strong></p> <p style="text-align: left">Malawi is one of the world’s most impoverished countries.

Everyone gets that product design is important, but why all the attention now?</b></p></blockquote> <p><strong>Maricel Cabahug:</strong> I see Fiori not just as an improvement in the user experience, but as a means to our goal of simplifying how people work. And I’m not just talking about efficiency. For me, Fiori can release innovation potential for a company. It means actually giving people in a particular role time to do other things; to rethink how they do their work. In IT we always talk about the benchmark of 70% spent on maintenance and 30% on innovation, and innovative companies push that envelope. If we make things easy, if we enable people in a particular role to accomplish what they have to accomplish faster, then they can spend more of their time on “value add” activities. That’s our mission for the user experience: to simplify the world of the end user, and in turn, simplify the business of the company.</p> <blockquote><p><b>SAP News: What fascinates you most about design?</b></p></blockquote> <p><strong>Maricel:</strong> Achieving the adoption of applications by the users is always the hardest part. For me, design is the answer to fill that gap.  What’s fascinating about software design is how it becomes the biggest topic only when it is not there or when it’s done poorly.  When executed flawlessly, design ceases to be a topic; it becomes an intrinsic quality of the product.</p> <div id="attachment_50243" class="wp-caption articleimage aligncenter" style="width: 500px; margin-right:10px; margin-left:10px"><a href="https://blogs.wdf.sap.corp/sapnews_en/2014/07/sap-fiori-simplifying-the-lives-of-end-users/maricel-cabahug/"><a href="https://blogs.wdf.sap.corp/sapnews_en/files/2014/07/Maricel-Cabahug.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-50243 " alt="Maricel Cabahug" src="https://blogs.wdf.sap.corp/sapnews_en/files/2014/07/Maricel-Cabahug.jpg" width="500" height="333" /></a></a><div class="image_label"> <div class="image_label_button" style="margin-right:2px"><a href="https://blogs.wdf.sap.corp/sapnews_en/2014/07/sap-fiori-simplifying-the-lives-of-end-users/maricel-cabahug/"><img width="15" height="15" src="https://blogs.wdf.sap.corp/sapnews_en/wp-content/themes/sapnews_v3/images/resize.gif" /></a></div> “Fiori can be a great way to motivate our customers to move to SAP HANA. Customers have actually confirmed to us that this is influencing them.” Maricel Cabahug, SVP, Global Design and User Experience (Photo: Axel Luther)</div></div> <blockquote><p><b>SAP News: SAP now offers Fiori for free with each software license. How do you expect that to affect our own product design?</b></p></blockquote> <p><strong>Maricel:</strong> The announcement at SAPPHIRE NOW awakened customers to the fact that they can have something that is really big and looks really beautiful and comes with each license. We might now think of Fiori as non-revenue-generating, but it actually opens up a lot of new opportunities. Fiori can be a great way to motivate our customers to move to SAP HANA. Customers have actually confirmed to us that this is influencing them. They love how it all works together; they love that it looks like it is one user experience for everything. We also always explain, for example, that Fiori works best with the SAP HANA platform.  This reminds me of the philosophical thought experiment, “If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?&#8221;.  If SAP HANA and our SAP HANA-based solutions are not adopted by end users due to a bad user experience, have we really delivered a solution?</p> <blockquote><p><b>SAP News: What should product teams know about how customers are receiving SAP Fiori? </b></p></blockquote> <p><strong>Maricel:</strong> I wish that the developers working on the Fiori applications could have witnessed the reception to the product at SAPPHIRE NOW in June. We’ve showcased so many products that we develop together with the various teams and the reception was almost unbelievable.  Our customers are finally convinced we get it!  On the other hand, we now have a big responsibility. The enthusiasm from our customers means that the product teams have to deliver consistently on the Fiori promise.</p> <table class="green_box_alone" border="0" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="3"> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p style="text-align: left"><b>Global Design and User Experience</b></p> <p style="text-align: left">Global Design is responsible for Fiori as a user experience paradigm. The team works very closely with central architecture and UI technology teams to deliver controls and frameworks to support product teams.  Global design also works very closely with designers from various product teams to evolve Fiori and make it the one user experience design language for all of SAP’s products.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <blockquote><p><b>SAP News: What does it mean that Sam Yen has now been appointed Chief Design Officer?</b></p></blockquote> <p><strong>Maricel:</strong> Sam has always had the support of the SAP Executive Board, but his appointment as Chief Design Officer for SAP signals internally and externally how serious the company is about product design. I think that employees understand that we are serious about design, but this appointment makes very clear to our customers that we value design and are serious about it.</p> <blockquote><p><strong>SAP News: What does the announcement mean for the user experience organization?</strong></p></blockquote> <p><strong>Maricel:</strong> The way we are now structured into lines of business might mean there are some changes made to the way we work with the product groups when it comes to designing the products. As a global design team, we should be working very closely with the business areas to ensure that the designers get deep business knowledge and domain knowledge within the products that they are developing. This means not only understanding and implementing what customers say they want, but also being in the position to offer them a solution that they might not have thought of.</p> <p>Regardless of organizational setups, it is important that we foster one strong design community within the company so that we can work very closely to support what’s required of us. It is a great opportunity for designers at SAP, because the impact that they are making is substantial and is now recognized. Designers are helping to redefine SAP and that’s awesome. They should feel very proud about that. At one year old, Fiori is still just a child and it needs to be taken care of and nurtured by the SAP community.</p> <div id="attachment_50259" class="wp-caption articleimage aligncenter" style="width: 500px; margin-right:10px; margin-left:10px"><a href="https://blogs.wdf.sap.corp/sapnews_en/?attachment_id=50259"><a href="https://blogs.wdf.sap.corp/sapnews_en/files/2014/07/fioricoffeecorner.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-50259" alt="fioricoffeecorner" src="https://blogs.wdf.sap.corp/sapnews_en/files/2014/07/fioricoffeecorner.jpg" width="500" height="375" /></a></a><div class="image_label"> <div class="image_label_button" style="margin-right:2px"><a href="https://blogs.wdf.sap.corp/sapnews_en/?attachment_id=50259"><img width="15" height="15" src="https://blogs.wdf.sap.corp/sapnews_en/wp-content/themes/sapnews_v3/images/resize.gif" /></a></div> By the end of the event, the Fiori Café at SAPPHIRE NOW caffeinated 5000 customers with (good!) coffee and generated approximately 1000 customer contacts.</div></div> <blockquote><p><b>SAP News: The whole company is talking about simplification. What’s happened to design thinking?</b></p></blockquote> <p><strong>Maricel:</strong> I think that design thinking (DT) is definitely still a priority for SAP, but I think that we also are taking a wider view. I see design thinking as a process for simplification. They both go hand in hand and don’t contradict each other. DT was very much hyped in the early stages to get things going, but now it seems to be becoming part of the fabric of our development process. Just look around at all the new DT spaces that are popping up all around the company and you can see that we are evolving into a company that increasingly takes design seriously, and design thinking is a part of that. You can say design thinking is the “how” of good design.</p> <blockquote><p><b>SAP News: What is the next step for Fiori?</b></p></blockquote> <p><b>Maricel:</b>  We first introduced Fiori in 2013 as a collection of the 25 most broadly used scenarios.  Since then, Fiori has evolved into the design language for all SAP solutions. The next challenge for Fiori is how to handle complex transactions without losing its principles: simplicity, focus on a role, and ability to work on multiple devices. Fiori must continue to evolve from its earlier versions while maintaining its identity. We could learn from<a href="http://amazon.com/" target="_blank"> Amazon.com </a>on how to introduce change constantly yet subtly.</p> <table class="blue_box_alone" border="0" cellspacing="3" cellpadding="3"> <tbody> <tr> <td><b>Useful Links:</b></p> <ul> <li> <div>Video: <a href="https://blogs.wdf.sap.corp/sapnews_en/2014/06/sap-fiori-the-power-of-simple/" target="_blank">SAP Fiori: The Power of Simple</a></div> </li> <li> <div><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-3bXK8f1RQ&amp;list=UUQuM7k9LJE99RrzPRW6qx3g" target="_blank">SAPPHIRE NOW Interview with Maricel Cabahug</a></div> </li> <li> <div style="text-align: left"><a href="https://jam4.sapjam.com/c/sapjam.com/groups/about_page/39pmQgrUOyUdqnuekMPaEZ" target="_blank">Design Jam Group</a></div> </li> <li> <div style="text-align: left"><a href="http://www.experience.sap.com" target="_blank">SAP User Experience Community</a></div> </li> <li> <div style="text-align: left">Press Release: <a href="http://www.news-sap.com/sapphire-now-sap-fiori-user-experience/" target="_blank">SAP Fiori Now Included With SAP Software (June 3, 2014)</a></div> </li> <li> <div style="text-align: left"><a href="https://open.sap.com/course/fiori1" target="_blank">Introduction to SAP Fiori UX</a></div> </li> <li> <div><a href="https://open.sap.com/course/uxn1" target="_blank">SAP’s UX Strategy in a Nutshell by Sam Yen</a></div> </li> </ul> <p style="text-align: left"> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded><wfw:commentRss>https://blogs.wdf.sap.corp/sapnews_en/2014/07/sap-fiori-simplifying-the-lives-of-end-users/feed/</wfw:commentRss><slash:comments>2</slash:comments></item></channel></rss>';
